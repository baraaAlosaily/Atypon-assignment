# Design decisions

1. At the begining i started draw wire fram as appear below 

![image](client/src/assets/wirefram-of-Atypon-Assignment.png)

2. In some component i used bootstrap like RiCloseLine RiMenu3Line and also seemore feature 

3. In some components i used UI Material like loading progress 

4. In general I create css file for each component but actually i use some of variables in index.css

# Highlights and lessons learn 

1. What i would highlight to is that if i have more time i can do some special features like pagination and add new feature like categorize searching 

2. What i learn while i build this application is how to managing my time to finish two features just in 8 hours and also how to write unit test react application
